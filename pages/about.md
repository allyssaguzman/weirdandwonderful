## About This Site

This site was created by Allyssa Guzman to showcase various open-source options for creating digital collections. To see the same content in different platforms, visit the (UT Libraries Digital Collection)[https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/creating-digital-collections] guide. 

Gina Bastone researched, curated, and developed the content for this exhibit. It was originally developed on Omeka.net and its current home is in a Spotlight exhibit on the [UT Libraries Exhibits](https://exhibits.lib.utexas.edu) site. Any typos, errors, broken links, or bizarre formatting were introduced by Allyssa when she created this CollectionBuilder-GH copy of the original exhibit. 

## About CollectionBuilder-GH

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
