# Slough Press
{% include feature/image.html objectid="164" width="50"%}

When Chuck Taylor and Susan Bright created [Slough Press](https://www.sloughpressbooks.com/) in the 1970s, they wanted to capture the “change of consciousness” happening in the era. As Taylor said, “It was the 70s, but the 60s in spirit.”[1] Bright eventually went on to create Plain View Press, but Taylor is still publishing new titles under Slough—a remarkable feat, given that many small presses fizzle out after a few years of work. Slough is additionally noteworthy for producing work by Chicanx and Latinx writers, and a standout is Christopher Carmona. Here we feature Carmona’s 2010 chapbook _My (Mex)quite Beat Refried Revolution_ published by Slough. Carmona draws inspiration from, but also subverts, the (mostly white) 1950s Beat Movement in this collection of stylish poems that document his Texas Chicano experience.
