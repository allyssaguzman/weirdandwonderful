# Acknowledgements & Bibliography

Gina Bastone, Humanities Librarian, created this exhibit in 2019-2020 for the UT Libraries. It features digitizations of chapbooks from the Ruth Stephan Poetry Collection, housed at the UT Poetry Center in the Perry-Castañeda Library.

## Acknowledgements
I am greatly indebted to the work of Mitch Cota. As a graduate student at the UT’s School of Information, Mitch created an exhibit for the Perry-Castañeda Library’s Scholars Commons called _[Lone Star imPRESSions, A History of Small Press in Texas](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/63268)._ Mitch conducted interviews with many of the writers and press editors featured here, and this exhibit would not have been possible without his research. If you would like to learn more about small presses in Texas, I recommend reading his exhibit catalog.
I would also like to thank the many writers, editors, and artists in Austin who have welcomed me into their literary community: Andrew Hilbert, Jim Trainer, Annar Verold, Stephanie Goehring, Chris Dock, Joe Brundidge, and all the good folks at Chicon Street Poets and Malvern Books.
Additional thanks are due to the many UT Libraries staff who helped make this exhibit possible: Mary Rader, Jenifer Flaxbart, Daniel Arbino, Sydney Kilgore, Allyssa Guzman, Anna Lamphear, Mirko Hanke, Ann Marchock, and Shiela Winchester.
